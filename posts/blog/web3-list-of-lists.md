I wrote a [blog](just-use-it) about being an early adopter user to get started in Web3. In my opinion, one of the best way to learn is just to dive deep into the rabbit hole and figure out for yourself.

Figure out your role, whether you want to be a builder, an investor, an analyst. If none of the above just be an early adopter user. You get paid to be a user in web3.

Below are the list of lists of materials that will provide you an easy entry into the world of web3
